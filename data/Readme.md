In order to get started with Fyers API we would like you to do the following things first.
1. Checkout our API docs :   https://myapi.fyers.in/docsv3
2. Create an APP using our API dashboard :   https://myapi.fyers.in/dashboard/

Once you have created an APP you can start using the below SDK

    print(e,response)  ## This will help you in debugging then and there itself like what was the error and also you would be able to see the value you got in response variable. instead of getting key_error for unsuccessfull response.



## Once you have generated accessToken now we can call multiple trading related or data related apis after that in order to do so we need to first initialize the fyerModel object with all the requried params.
